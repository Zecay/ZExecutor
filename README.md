Roblox Executor Used To Execute Scripts

HOW TO DOWNLOAD :
Click Code ( Green Button ),  And Then Click Download ZIP.

HOW TO RUN THE EXECUTOR (IMPORTANT) :
First Things First You Need To Extract The File.
If It Gives A WinRar File Again Then Extract It Again.
The File Should Then Be Named ExploitTemplate ( To Create It I Used A Template ).
Go Into ExploitTemplate And Double Click ExploitTemplate, Then You Should Be Getting Much Files And You Have To Double Click On "bin".
When You Are In Bin Double Click Debug And Run "ZExecutor.exe".
And Done! You Should Have The Executor Running!

NOTE :
